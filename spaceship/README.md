## Take me there!

My mommy told me not to talk to aliens. She said nothing about building a spaceship.

Who would believe I can make it from PETG on a Prusa MINI? 

### Spaceship Stand (new version)

-   No supports!
-   Infill 15%
-   Variable layer height

### Spaceship Stand (old version)

-   Print with supports
-   Overhang angle limit 27°
-   Infill 15%
-   Variable layer height
-   Max. nozzle size 0.4 mm (else not perfect results)

## Front of the spaceship (new & old version)

-   No supports!
-   Print with brim, 7mm, distance 0.1 mm
-   Infill does not matter, can be 0% or 10%

### Coin hole

There are two subvariants of the coin hole: a straight version and a 45° version. This design choice was made to accommodate printers that may print thread too tightly. My goal was to prevent overtightening the model, which could lead to issues with opening. I received feedback from Robert favoring the straight version without my compensation, so I have included a straight coin hole version in the STL files. This version does not have any compensation.

## Body of the spaceship with high power engine (new & old version)

-   Supports on first layer; overhang angle limit 20° 
-   Print with brim, 7mm, distance 0.1 mm
-   Infill - 10%
-   Max. nozzle size 0.4 mm (else not perfect results, especially at the end of the wings)

## Post processing

-   Remove brim with a sharp knife.
-   Attach the stand to the spaceship body with:
    -   2x M4x12 flat head screws for Prusa MINI version
    -   2x M5x14 flat head screws for Prusa MK3 version
-   Give your ship some cool color coating such as *electric mucus* green (HEX: #66C88F; RAL 6024).

When good is not enough...
