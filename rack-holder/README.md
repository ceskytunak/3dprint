This project is also available on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/629175-modular-rack-case-for-musical-gear)

## Description

This modular 4U height rack case is the perfect solution for storing and organizing your musical gear. It can hold up to four independent modules, and multiple cases can be stacked together and reinforced with steel threaded rods for added stability. The connecting bolts and nuts are designed for M5, and either standard or nylon nuts can be used.

This rack case can be printed from either PLA, PETG or ASA but if you are using a Prusa MINI printer, be sure to disable skirt for this print. Reccommended nozzle is 0.4 and layer height 0.2. But 0.6 nozzle and 0.25 Draft is still doable.

### Features

### How to use

1.  Print the individual modules and prepare connecting hardware.
2.  Assemble the modules according to the included instructions.
3.  Stack the modules and secure them together with the steel threaded rods.
4.  Mount your gear to the modules with rubber pads to avoid rack crush.

### BOM (Bill Of Material)

*Mounting gear (required)*

-   *M5x25 cylindrical head inbus screw - DIN 912 OR  M5x25 button head inbus screw ISO 7380 (4pcs per device)*
-   *Pad with rubber 5x14 (4pcs per device). Smaller rubber pads would be better, but I didn't foud them on the market.*
-   *M5 hex nut (4pcs per device)*

*Stability improvement (optional)*

-   M5 threaded rod (2pcs)
-   M5 hex nut (4pcs)
-   M5 hex nut with nylon (4pcs)

*Vertical stacking (optional)*

-   M5x45 cylindrical head inbus screw - DIN 912 (4pcs)
-   M5 hex nut (4pcs)

*Horizontal stitching (optional)*

-   M5x35 cylindrical head inbus screw - DIN 912 (4pcs)
-   M5 hex nut (4pcs)

*Side covers (optional)*

-   M5x25 cylindrical head inbus screws - DIN 912 (8pcs)
-   M5 hex nut (8pcs)

### Improving stability *(optional)*

This step will help to prevent the rack from wobbling or shifting.

1.  Cut 2 pieces of M5 threaded rod to 48.9 mm width and sand edges. 
2.  On each rod, tighten one normal hex nut to the temporary position approx 5cm from the edge.
3.  Insert the rod with the nut into the corner hole of the rack holder from the side where there is no space designed for the nut. 
4.  Move rod into the hole of second rack holder at the other side.
5.  Tighten this assembly with nylon hex nut from the outer sides on both parts.
6.  Tighten nylon hex nuts from outer sides just at the tip of the threaded rods.
7.  Tighten both temporary hex nut just at the side of the rack holder from the inner side.

### Vertical stacking *(optional)*

-   Two racks can be vertically stacked using 4x M5x45 cylindrical head inbus screws and 4x hex nuts.

### Horizontal stitching *(optional)*

This requires to print *Rackholder-sidemount.stl*

-   Two racks can be stitched side by side using 4x M5x35 cylindrical head inbus screws and 4x hex nuts, without interfering with the inner or outer space of the rack case.
-   The racks should be aligned carefully before tightening the screws and nuts.

### Side covers *(optional)*

This requires to have *Rackholder-sidemount.stl* installed

-   Mount cover plates (Side-cover-plate.stl) to the rackholder sidemounts with 8x M5x25 cylindrical head inbus screws (or flat head inbus screws) per side and tighten them with M5 hex nuts.

### Rear side cover *(optional)*

-   The rear side of the rackholder has holes for mounting a custom backplate (not included). The plate dimensions are 18x48.9cm, and the holes are M5 ready. The center of each hole is 10mm from the side edge and 37.5mm and 67.5 respectively from the bottom/top edge.

### Angled stand *(optional)*

This requires to have *Rackholder-angled-stand.stl* printed 2x.

-   11.5° stand can be attached into bottom holes dedicated for rack stacking.
-   Use two M5x25 cylindrical head inbus screws per one stand and M5 hex nut respectively.
