### Features

-   Easy to install
-   Includes all necessary hardware and instructions
-   Optional CV conversion available

### Instructions

1.  Dismantle the WSG/01 case.
2.  Desolder the power supply connector, power switch, and 6.3mm jack.
3.  Install the WSG/01 synthesizer into the Eurorack panel using the M3x14 screws and square nuts.
4.  Install the TSR 6.3mm jack socket into one of the panel holes and secure it with the original hex nut.
5.  Solder the power supply module with step-down converter from Eurorack +12V to WSG +9V.
6.  Tune the step-down converter's trimmer to +9V with a multimeter.
7.  Solder the OUT pins from the converter onto the synthesizer's power cables.
8.  Install the power module onto the L-shaped power holder with M3 screws and hex nuts.
9.  Attach the completed power holder onto the backside of the synth plate with M3 screws and hex nuts.
10. Install the completed module into your Eurorack system.

### Optional CV conversion:

1.  Convert the output line signal into CV with a pitch-to-CV converter and output it in a TS socket.
2.  Use a SparkFun OpAmp Breakout, LMV358 to convert the weak WSG signal into a hotter Eurorack CV.
3.  Drill one more hole into the side panel and attach a 3.5mm TS connector.
4.  Solder power from Eurorack 5V to the SparkFun VCC.
5.  Solder the WSG signal out to the SparkFun IN.
6.  Solder the SparkFun OUT to the 3.5mm TS tip.
7.  Solder the 3.5mm TS ring to common GND.

### Print hints:

-   Print from PETG or ASA.
-   Print with 60% gyroid infill.
