This project is also available on [Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/630873-compact-capsule-filler-00-size-with-credit-card-mi)

## Description

This compact capsule filler is designed to fill 24 capsules of size 00 in one batch using a credit card as a mixture dispenser. 

The capsule filler is made up of three functional parts: a *base frame*, a *capsule holder*, and a *stuffer*. The base frame provides a sturdy base for the capsule holder. The capsule holder is designed to hold the capsules in place while they are being filled. The stuffer is used to pack the mixture tightly into the capsules.

## Features

-   Compact and lightweight design
-   Easy to use

-   In variant for size 00
-   Uses a credit card as a mixture dispenser

## Benefits

-   Save time and money by filling capsules yourself
-   Make your own custom herbal supplements, vitamins, or other encapsulated products
-   Ensure that your capsules are filled with the exact ingredients and dosage that you need
-   Reduce waste by eliminating the need for pre-filled capsule

## Printing Tips

-   Print with Food safe Compliant materials with higher thermal resistance. Examples of such materials include PLA HT, PEI, and Co-polyester.
-   Print the *Capsule_filler-stuffer_base.stl* and *Capsule_filler-capsule_holder.stl* parts with higher detail.
-   Infill is not very important for this print.

## Assembly instructions

Tightly screw together the *Capsule_filler-stuffer_base.stl* and *Capsule_filler-stuffer_handle.stl* parts using two *M3x8 cylindrical head inbus screws (DIN 912)* and two *M3 hex nylon nuts*.

## Model revisions

revision-2 - smaller tolerancies, more rounded corners, robust base frame and stuffer
revision-1 - bigger tolerancies

## Usage

To use the capsule filler, simply place the capsule holder on top of the base frame and load the capsule bottoms into the holes. Then, dispense the desired mixture equally over the capsules using the credit card mixture dispenser. Take the stuffer and pack the mixture tightly into the capsules. Repeat steps 3 and 4 one or two more times, if desired.

Once the capsules are filled, remove any residual mixture from the overflow part of the capsule holder. Then, slowly slide the capsule holder down from the base frame to the table. The capsule bottoms will rise above the capsule holder bottom, allowing you to put the capsule tops on them. Finally, remove any residual mixture from the capsule bottoms and eject the filled capsules from the capsule holder.

This compact capsule filler is a great way to fill capsules quickly and easily. It is perfect for making your own herbal supplements, vitamins, or other encapsulated products.

## Model inspiration

Many years ago, I found a capsule filler design that I really liked and made one for myself. One day, I lent it to my friend, but he never returned it. I wanted to make another one, but I couldn't find the original design again. So, I decided to reinvent it from scratch.

I've used this pocket capsule filler to fill over 15,000 capsules so far, and I'm confident that it's a great design. I hope you like it too!
