The Electron Analog 4 MKI 19" Rack Ears are a great way to make your Analog 4 MKI part of bigger static setup.

It is compatible with standard 19"rack with inner width of 458.5 mm, but it can also fit some non-standard 19" racks not respecting minimal inner width (thanks to extra 5 mm gap on each side before supports dives in).  

#### Printing tips

-   Print without supports.
-   The rack ears should be made out of strong plastic such as Modified PLA, ASA or ABS.
-   Print with 15% triangle infill.
-   Add infil in area around bolt holes.
