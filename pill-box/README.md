## Description

### The pillbox that's fun to open, even if you don't want to take your pills.

It amazing for daily usage because it is fun to use it. It is not just another PillBox, this is **BrainZap! Awesome PillBox**.

PillBox is designed to store your favorite *BrainZap!* capsules and is perfectly compatible with minibatches produced by [Compact Capsule Filler](https://www.printables.com/model/630873-compact-capsule-filler-00-size-with-credit-card-mi).

## Printing tips

### Cap

-   Print the cap with vertical wall number of perimeters 3 or 4. This is super important if you want to have the best experience from PillBox opening. Additional filament gives little extra weight to the edges of a cap and its inertia while spinnig during opening or closing the Bottle is that feeling you will love on this bottle.
-   Print the cap with 10% concentric infill.
-   Avoid crossing perimeters.

### Body

-   Print the body with 100% infill.
-   Avoid crossing perimeters.
-   Adjust layer height for PillBox body

## Material choice

The truth is, most of us just print from PLA and PETG. 

Sometimes is great time to stop and think. Such as this moment. When we are about o print box for storing Food Supplements, material selection is not just about color. We will definitely not gonna die if we print PillBox from regular fillament, but let's thing about it a little.

I don't want to invent a wheel again, so read this article about [Food Safe Compliance](https://all3dp.com/2/food-safe-3d-printer-filament-best-brands/) and 3D printing. It is quite interesting reading and thoughts.

## Model versions

## Label area

You can print and stick information onto dedicated area. Dimesnions of such a label depends on a type of PillBoxy body.

| **Body type** | **Label Height** | **Label Length** |
| Tribute | 30 mm | 125,6 mm |
| Small | 35 mm | 125,6 mm |
| Medium | 40 mm | 141,3 mm |
| Big | 50 mm | 157,1 mm |
| Large | 55 mm | 175,84 mm |

## PillBox evolution

Design a bottle is hell easy. You draw a shape, revolve around axis and voila! Bottle here. Then you do the same with a cap. This takes around 10 minutes.

You make first print. And then you start optimizing the cap. And there is still something. So at the end of a day, you still have a one PillBox, 16 variants, 4 coffees and probably 20 hours of intimacy with CAD program and 3D printer. You learn a lot about threads and facet offsets.

I wanted to make wide range of bottle sizes and cap designs. All parameters are programmable so in theory I can derrive any kind of bottle configuration.

## BrainZap!

This PillBox was designed for the project [BrainZap! Open Source Brain Supplement](https://brainzap.space). Check this out.

## Inspiration

Long time ago I print such a pill box from Thingiverse and I love it. I decided to make my own collection of pillboxes but this one was my inspiration all the time I was designing this model.

Version of *PillBox_body - tribute.stl* with *PillBox_awesome_cap - dingo dog edition.stl* is a my tribute to this visualy almost identical model.

## Model optimizations

Whole PillBox collection has fine tuned details such as optimized body bottom for printing, thinner walls to avoid unecessary infill, cap top inner space for airtight, different curvature of cap surface, smoother transitions from etiquete label area to bottle neck, heavier cap outer perimeter for better feeling while opening.
