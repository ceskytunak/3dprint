This 3D-printed IDC box header frame is designed to convert a regular 2-row pin header into an IDC box header. This is a useful solution for those who need to replace an IDC box header but cannot find one in stock, or for those who want to create a custom IDC box header for their specific application.

## Features

-   Converts a regular 2-row pin header into an IDC box header
-   Ensures correct orientation of the power cord tab
-   Easy to assemble

## Benefits

-   Replace a broken or missing IDC box header without having to buy a new one
-   Create a custom IDC box header for your specific needs

## Applications

-   Desktop synthesizers
-   Eurorack modules
-   Other electronic devices that use IDC box headers

## How to Use

1.  Cut 5 columns of 2-pin row header.
2.  Insert the 2-pin row header into the frame and align the pins into the box.
3.  Stick the frame and the 2-pin row header together with superglue.

## Tips

-   Be careful when cutting the 2-pin row header to avoid cutting yourself.
-   Use a strong superglue to ensure that the frame and the 2-pin row header are securely bonded.
-   Make sure that the frame is printed from a heat-resistant material, such as PLA Â HT, PETG or ABS, if it will be used in a high-temperature environment.
