## Description

There are many door stoppers on the market, but most of them have sharp edges that can be dangerous, don't work well on slippery or uneven surfaces, and can't be permanently attached to the floor.

This new door stopper is designed to address all of these problems. It has no sharp edges, so it is safe to step on, even barefoot. It also works on all types of surfaces, including slippery floors and uneven carpets. And it can be permanently attached to the floor using the built-in hole.

This makes the new door stopper the perfect choice for homes with children or pets, as well as for businesses and other high-traffic areas.

### Features:

-   2-in-1 design: Can be used as a door stopper or a wall protector

-   Built-in 5mm hole for attaching to the floor

-   Use a flexible filament, such as TPU 95A or TPU 90A, for best results.
-   Set the infill to 10-20% GRID.
-   Supports and rafts are not necessary.
-   Use an anti-adhesive spray, such as 3D LAC, to prevent the TPU from sticking to the build plate.
