This desktop light stand is designed to be a stackable and portable solution for mounting Stairville LED PAR 36 theatre lights. It has two mounting options: one in the center of the top part of the holder and one on the side. This allows you to mount the light in the classical way through the center hole, but you can also attach two Stairville lights together and mount them together on one stand.

The stand is also compatible with many other standalone lights, not just the Stairville LED PAR 36. The mounting hole diameter is 10mm.

The stand is stackable, so if you need to have more stands, they can be stored together in a space-efficient way.

The stand can be mounted on columns with nylon straps or duct tape to provide a sturdy base for the light in improvised conditions.
