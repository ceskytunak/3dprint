## Description
Tired of scraping ice with a boring old scraper? Upgrade to the Red Devil Ice Scraper and watch that frost disappear faster than you can say *'hot damn!'*

Sacrifice some high-quality filament such as bloody strong *Modified PLA, ASA or PETG* and summon this STL model into your most favorite scraper. 

Design is hell strong, you can keep your bloody slicer settings on 2 perimeters and 15% infill (tested on *Modified PLA AzureFilms Strongman*), but if you are using evilly cheaper filaments, go higher with infill such as 20% and increase wall thickness with 3 or 4 perimeters.

Torture your printer for an hour and whisper GCODE instructions towards your printer while printing.

## Safety instructions

-   do not swallow

## Disclamer*

Summoning something else than a scraper if misspeling GCODE is out of our liability. Read your GCODE twice before spelling.
